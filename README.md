# GenomeCruzer for CIBB

Welcome!
This repository provides supporting material for the poster **‚ÄúGenomeCruzer: a 3D interactive environment for genomic data visualization and analysis‚Äù** presented at **CIBB - Conferences on Computational Intelligence Methods for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics**.

## About the Project

Next-generation sequencing has transformed both cancer research and clinical practice, producing vast amounts of omics data. While these datasets hold extraordinary potential, their sheer volume and complexity often hinder effective interpretation.

**GenomeCruzer** has been developed in cooperation with **Kairos3D** as a novel software platform designed to address this challenge. By leveraging optimized graphical metaphors and 3D representations, GenomeCruzer enables the simultaneous visualization of multiple layers of biological information, including:

- **Continuous variables** such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and copy number alterations (CNA), represented through visual cues like color, height, and size.  
- **Discrete variables** (e.g., pathways, classifications) represented with visual effects such as blinking, grouping, or highlighting.

This approach allows users to intuitively recognize patterns, relationships, and functional contexts that would otherwise remain hidden in large-scale genomic datasets.
